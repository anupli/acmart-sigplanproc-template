\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Putting related work at the front of the paper (after the intro) in
all submissions.  Your reviewers (PC members) are busy, must often
read 20 or more papers, and are not necessarily expert on your topic.
If you succinctly explain the limitations of previous work and how
your work \emph{relates} to all the prior work and hopefully improves
over it, the PC member will be more motivated to recommend accepting
your submission.

It may make sense to move related work toward the end of the paper for
a camera-ready version (which is, after all, for a different
audience).
