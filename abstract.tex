  A good abstract and introduction should clearly state what problem
  the paper is addressing (e.g., making GC go faster, improving the
  user experience when programs have bugs, finding bugs), the
  contribution toward solving this problem (e.g., a GC that combines
  locality and efficiency, a new mechanism for finding leaks, a new
  programming language), the results (e.g., programs run faster or do
  not crash or are easier to understand), and include a summary
  statement that indicates what this means (e.g., GC can be a
  performance win instead of a cost, we can build better performing
  VMs now, we can keep programs running with errors of type y, or
  programmers can write programs more succinctly).
